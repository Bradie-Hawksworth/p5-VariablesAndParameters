# :wave: The Basics of P5 

## ðŸ¤“ Course overview and learning outcomes 

This assignment is going to build on from the p5-Squares assignment. In the p5 Squares assignment we created multiple squares on the canvas. You may have also added some dots to respresent the faces of a dice. In this assignment, we are going to build on from this and create functions to create the dice faces for us. 

[You can find the documentation for functions here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions).

When you set your p5 project up with the code found on this assignment. Where can you call diceValueOne() to produce the following output?

*REMEMBER - keep regularly testing changes. How has the change effected your program?*

* diceValueTwo()
* diceValueThree()
* diceValueFour()
* diceValueFive()
* diceValueSix()
